   This guide assumes that you are familiar with PostgreSQL administration and
   streaming replication concepts. For further details on streaming
   replication, see the PostgreSQL documentation section on <ulink

   The following terms are used throughout the &repmgr; documentation.

     <term>replication cluster</term>
     <listitem>
      <simpara>
       In the &repmgr; documentation, "replication cluster" refers to the network
       of PostgreSQL servers connected by streaming replication.
      </simpara>
     </listitem>
    </varlistentry>

    <varlistentry>
     <term>node</term>
     <listitem>
      <simpara>
       A node is a single PostgreSQL server within a replication cluster.
      </simpara>
     </listitem>
    </varlistentry>

    <varlistentry>
     <term>upstream node</term>
     <listitem>
      <simpara>
       The node a standby server connects to, in order to receive streaming replication.
       This is either the primary server, or in the case of cascading replication, another
       standby.
      </simpara>
     </listitem>
    </varlistentry>

    <varlistentry>
     <term>failover</term>
     <listitem>
      <simpara>
       This is the action which occurs if a primary server fails and a suitable standby
       is  promoted as the new primary. The &repmgrd; daemon supports automatic failover
       to minimise downtime.
      </simpara>
     </listitem>
    </varlistentry>

    <varlistentry>
     <term>switchover</term>
     <listitem>
      <simpara>
       In certain circumstances, such as hardware or operating system maintenance,
       it's necessary to take a primary server offline; in this case a controlled
       switchover is necessary, whereby a suitable standby is promoted and the
       existing primary removed from the replication cluster in a controlled manner.
       The &repmgr; command line client provides this functionality.
      </simpara>
     </listitem>
    </varlistentry>

    <varlistentry>
     <term>fencing</term>
     <listitem>
      <simpara>
       In a failover situation, following the promotion of a new standby, it's
       essential that the previous primary does not unexpectedly come back on
       line, which would result in a split-brain situation. To prevent this,
       the failed primary should be isolated from applications, i.e. "fenced off".
      </simpara>

    </varlistentry>
   <varlistentry id="witness-server">
     <term>witness server</term>
     <listitem>
      <para>
        &repmgr; provides functionality to set up a so-called "witness server" to
        assist in determining a new primary server in a failover situation with more
        than one standby. The witness server itself is not part of the replication
        cluster, although it does contain a copy of the repmgr metadata schema.
      </para>
      <para>
        The purpose of a witness server is to provide a "casting vote" where servers
        in the replication cluster are split over more than one location. In the event
        of a loss of connectivity between locations, the presence or absence of
        the witness server will decide whether a server at that location is promoted
        to primary; this is to prevent a "split-brain" situation where an isolated
        location interprets a network outage as a failure of the (remote) primary and
        promotes a (local) standby.
      </para>
      <para>
        A witness server only needs to be created if &repmgrd;
        is in use.

  <title>Components</title>
  <para>
  &repmgr; is a suite of open-source tools to manage replication and failover
  within a cluster of PostgreSQL servers. It supports and enhances PostgreSQL's
  built-in streaming replication, which provides a single read/write primary server
  and one or more read-only standbys containing near-real time copies of the primary
  server's database. It provides two main tools:

  <para>
   In order to effectively manage a replication cluster, &repmgr; needs to store
   information about the servers in the cluster in a dedicated database schema.
   This schema is automatically created by the &repmgr; extension, which is installed
   during the first step in initializing a &repmgr;-administered cluster
   (<command><link linkend="repmgr-primary-register">repmgr primary register</link></command>)
   and contains the following objects:

   The &repmgr; metadata schema can be stored in an existing database or in its own
   dedicated database. Note that the &repmgr; metadata schema cannot reside on a database
   server which is not part of the replication cluster managed by &repmgr;.
  </para>
  <para>
   A database user must be available for &repmgr; to access this database and perform
   necessary changes. This user does not need to be a superuser, however some operations
   such as initial installation of the &repmgr; extension will require a superuser
   connection (this can be specified where required with the command line option
   <literal>--superuser</literal>).
