  <para>
    &repmgr; 4.x provides support for monitoring a pair of BDR 2.x nodes and taking action in
    case one of the nodes fails.
  </para>
  <note>
    <simpara>
      Due to the nature of BDR 1.x/2.x, it's only safe to use this solution for
      a two-node scenario. Introducing additional nodes will create an inherent
      risk of node desynchronisation if a node goes down without being cleanly
      removed from the cluster.
    </simpara>
  </note>
  <para>
    In contrast to streaming replication, there's no concept of "promoting" a new
    primary node with BDR. Instead, "failover" involves monitoring both nodes
    with &repmgrd; and redirecting queries from the failed node to the remaining
    active node. This can be done by using an
    <link linkend="event-notifications">event notification</link> script
    which is called by &repmgrd; to dynamically
    reconfigure a proxy server/connection pooler such as <application>PgBouncer</application>.
  </para>

  <note>
    <simpara>
      This &repmgr; functionality is for BDR 2.x only running on PostgreSQL 9.4/9.6.
      It is <emphasis>not</emphasis> required for later BDR versions.

    <para>
      &repmgr; 4 requires PostgreSQL 9.4 or 9.6 with the BDR 2 extension
      enabled and configured for a two-node BDR network. &repmgr; 4 packages
      must be installed on each node before attempting to configure
      <application>repmgr</application>.

        &repmgr; 4 will refuse to install if it detects more than two BDR nodes.

    <para>
      Application database connections *must* be passed through a proxy server/
      connection pooler such as <application>PgBouncer</application>, and it must be possible to dynamically
      reconfigure that from &repmgrd;. The example demonstrated in this document
      will use <application>PgBouncer</application>
    </para>
    <para>
      The proxy server / connection poolers must <emphasis>not</emphasis>
      be installed on the database servers.
    </para>
    <para>
      For this example, it's assumed password-less SSH connections are available
      from the PostgreSQL servers to the servers where <application>PgBouncer</application>
      runs, and that the user on those servers has permission to alter the
      <application>PgBouncer</application> configuration files.
    </para>
    <para>
      PostgreSQL connections must be possible between each node, and each node
      must be able to connect to each PgBouncer instance.

    <title>Configuration</title>
    <para>
      A sample configuration for <filename>repmgr.conf</filename> on each
      BDR node would look like this:
      <programlisting>
        # Node information
        node_id=1
        node_name='node1'
        conninfo='host=node1 dbname=bdrtest user=repmgr connect_timeout=2'
        data_directory='/var/lib/postgresql/data'
        replication_type='bdr'

        # Event notification configuration
        event_notifications='bdr_failover'
        event_notification_command='/path/to/bdr-pgbouncer.sh %n %e %s "%c" "%a" >> /tmp/bdr-failover.log 2>&amp;1'

        # repmgrd options
        monitor_interval_secs=5
        reconnect_attempts=6
        reconnect_interval=5</programlisting>
    </para>
    <para>
      Adjust settings as appropriate; copy and adjust for the second node (particularly
      the values <varname>node_id</varname>, <varname>node_name</varname>
      and <varname>conninfo</varname>).
    </para>
    <para>
      Note that the values provided for the <varname>conninfo</varname> string
      must be valid for connections from <emphasis>both</emphasis> nodes in the
      replication cluster. The database must be the BDR-enabled database.
    </para>
    <para>
      If defined, the <varname>event_notifications</varname> parameter will restrict
      execution of the script defined in  <varname>event_notification_command</varname>
      to the specified event(s).
    </para>
    <note>
      <simpara>
        <varname>event_notification_command</varname> is the script which does the actual "heavy lifting"
        of reconfiguring the proxy server/ connection pooler. It is fully
        user-definable; see section <xref linkend="bdr-event-notification-command"/> for a reference
        implementation.

      At this point the meta data for both nodes has been created; executing
