Known issues in repmgr
======================

* When running repmgr against a remote machine, operations that start
  the database server using the ``pg_ctl`` command may accidentally
  terminate after their associated ssh session ends.

* PGPASSFILE may not be passed to pg_basebackup

Planned feature improvements
============================

* A better check which standby did receive most of the data

* Make the fact that a standby may be delayed a factor in the voting
  algorithm

* include support for delayed standbys

* Create the repmgr user/database on "master register".

* Use pg_basebackup for the data directory, and ALSO rsync for the
configuration files.

* Use pg_basebackup -X s
  NOTE: this can be used by including `-X s` in the configuration parameter
  `pg_basebackup_options`
